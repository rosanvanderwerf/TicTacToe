# TicTacToe

This application  is a version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game (kinda)! 

I actually wanted to add something extra (the remainders are commented). Here it would be possible to play games against each other. And there would be a counter that woul keep up the scores.
When the "Restart"-button would be pressed, all the scores would be set to zero. I wasn't able to finish in time. That's why some lines of code are still visible.
You can try uncommenting them to see what I was trying to do.

Unfortunately, I also wasn't able to make an UpdateUI method, that could change the user interface based  on the board (in Class Game).
